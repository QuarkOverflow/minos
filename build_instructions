Build:
To build the project use the fake make script (./make) with the parameter 'img' to create a FAT12 disk image or 'k' to build the binary kernel (which will eventually work with multi boot)

The image can be loaded directly into Bochs/Qemu as a floppy image or use VirtualBox (VBoxManage) to create a .vdi from the image file

The build.img can be flashed to a usb and booted using legacy mode on real hardware.
