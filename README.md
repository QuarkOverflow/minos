minOS
=====

A minimal bare bones operating system based on a monolithic kernel design written purely in Assembly language.

Legacy boots from a pre-built disk image with planned support for GRUB multiboot.

Kernel size: 8 KiB

System Requirements:

* RAM: 3 MiB
* CPU: x86-64

Microprocessors tested on:

* Intel Pentium 4
* Intel Core 2

I want to say a big thanks to the Flat Assembler community (http://flatassembler.net) for their help and advice - The boards are full of great examples and I hope they inspire more to take up assembly programming.
